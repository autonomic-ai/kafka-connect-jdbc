Confluent JDBC Connector
========================

You can use the JDBC source connector to import data from any relational database with a JDBC driver into Kafka
topics. You can use the JDBC sink connector to export data from Kafka topics to any relational database with a JDBC driver.
The JDBC connector supports a wide variety of databases without requiring custom code for each one.
